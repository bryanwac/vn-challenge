## About it

 - java Version: 20 - Spring Boot Version: 20
 - To run tests use the Maven Terminal by typing 'mvn test' and pressing Ctrl + Enter


### Regarding the question about Exercise 1:

To ensure that the code remains secure against bugs and performs well with minor feature adjustments, you can follow these best practices:

1. Unit Testing: Write comprehensive unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit to validate the behavior of the printNumbers method. Test various scenarios, including different ranges, edge cases, and possible special cases.

2. Input Validation: Add input validation checks to ensure that the start number is less than or equal to the end number. If the condition is not met, you can throw an exception or handle the error appropriately.

3. Code Reviews: Conduct regular code reviews where experienced developers review and provide feedback on the code changes. This helps identify potential issues and ensures that the changes align with the desired functionality.

4. Version Control: Utilize a version control system like Git to manage the code. This allows developers to track changes, create branches for feature adjustments, and easily revert to a functional version if needed.

5. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Use CI/CD pipelines to automatically build, test, and deploy the code. This ensures that any changes made by developers are thoroughly tested and deployed to the production environment in a controlled manner.

6. Documentation and Comments: Include clear and concise documentation within the code, explaining the purpose of components and their behavior. Additionally, use comments to provide insights into the code logic, making it easier for developers to understand and modify the code in the future.

# LanguageAnalyzer

The `LanguageAnalyzer` is a utility class that provides various methods to analyze and process information about countries and their languages. It offers functionalities such as parsing JSON data, counting total countries, finding countries with the most languages, counting total languages, and finding the country with the highest number of languages.

## Functionality

### 1. Parsing JSON Data

The `parseJson` method takes a JSON string as input and parses it into a list of `Country` objects. Each `Country` object represents a country with its associated languages.

### 2. Counting Total Countries

The `getTotalCountries` method calculates and returns the total number of countries in the provided list of `Country` objects.

### 3. Finding Country with Most Languages

The `getCountryWithMostLanguages` method determines the country that has the most official languages based on the provided language parameter. It returns the `Country` object with the highest number of languages that include the specified language.

### 4. Counting Total Languages

The `countTotalLanguages` method calculates and returns the total number of unique languages among all the countries in the provided list of `Country` objects.

### 5. Finding Country with Highest Languages

The `getCountryWithHighestLanguages` method identifies the country with the highest number of official languages among the provided list of `Country` objects. It returns the `Country` object with the most languages.

## Tests

The `LanguageAnalyzerTest` class contains test cases for the methods in the `LanguageAnalyzer` class. The tests cover the following scenarios:

1. `testParseJson`: Ensures that the `parseJson` method correctly parses the JSON data into a list of `Country` objects. It checks the correctness of the country name and associated languages for a specific example.

2. `testGetTotalCountries`: Verifies that the `getTotalCountries` method calculates the correct total number of countries from a given list of `Country` objects.

3. `testGetCountryWithMostLanguages`: Checks if the `getCountryWithMostLanguages` method correctly identifies the country with the most official languages that include a specific language.

4. `testCountTotalLanguages`: Validates the accuracy of the `countTotalLanguages` method in calculating the total number of unique languages among all countries.

5. `testGetCountryWithHighestLanguages`: Tests whether the `getCountryWithHighestLanguages` method correctly determines the country with the highest number of official languages.

Note: The JSON data used in the tests includes a sample set of countries and their languages. You can modify the JSON data or add more test cases as needed to cover additional scenarios.
Note2: Tests uses a bigger JSON of countries.

# NumberPrinter

The `NumberPrinter` class is a component that prints numbers based on certain conditions. It takes a start and end number as input and prints the numbers from the start to the end according to the following rules:

- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints "Visual Nuts".
- If the number is divisible by 3, it prints "Visual".
- If the number is divisible by 5, it prints "Nuts".
- Otherwise, it prints the number itself.

## Functionality

The `NumberPrinter` class provides a single method called `printNumbers`, which takes two integer parameters: `start` and `end`. The method prints the numbers from `start` to `end` based on the conditions mentioned above.

## Tests

The `NumberPrintFirstTest` class contains a test case for the `printNumbers` method of the `NumberPrinter` class. The test case covers the following scenarios:

1. `testPrintNumbers`: Tests the behavior of the `printNumbers` method with different input ranges.

    - Test case 1: Valid range (1 to 100): Prints the numbers from 1 to 100, following the specified conditions.
    - Test case 2: Valid range (50 to 75): Prints the numbers from 50 to 75, following the specified conditions.
    - Test case 3: Invalid range (start > end): Expects an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown when the start number is greater than the end number.

Note: The `assertThrows` method is used to validate that an exception is thrown for the invalid input case.

Feel free to explore and modify the input ranges in the test cases to cover different scenarios or adjust the conditions in the `NumberPrinter` class based on your requirements.
